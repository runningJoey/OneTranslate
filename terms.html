<h1>Terms of service</h1>
<p>Last updated <em>March 01, 2025</em></p>
<P>These Terms and Conditions ("Terms", "Terms and Conditions") govern your relationship with website (the "Service") operated by Greatspot ("us", "we", or "our").</P>
<p>Please read these Terms and Conditions carefully before using the Service.</p>
<p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who access or use the Service.
    By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms then you may not access the Service.</p>

 <h2>Subscriptions</h2>  
 <p>Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing Cycle"). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.</p>
 <p>At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Noto cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal through your online account management page .</p> 
 <h2>Free Trial</h2>
 <p>Greatspot may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with a free trial for a limited period of time ("Free Trial‚Äù).</p>
 <p>You may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign up for the Free Trial.</p>
 <p>If you do enter your billing information when signing up for the Free Trial, you will not be charged by Noto until the Free Trial has expired. On the last day of the Free Trial period, unless you cancelled your Subscription, you will be automatically charged the applicable Subscription fees for the type of Subscription you have selected.</p>
 <p>At any time and without notice, Noto reserves the right to (i) modify the terms and conditions of the Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial offer.</p>
 <h2>Fee Changes</h2>
 <p>Greatspot, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.</p>
 <p>Greatspot will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such change becomes effective.</p>
 <p>Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.</p>
 <h2>Refunds</h2>
 <p>Except when required by law, paid Subscription fees are non-refundable.</p>
 <h2>Limitation Of Liability</h2>
 <p>In no event shall Greatspot, nor its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from (i) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the Service; (ii) any conduct or content of any third party on the Service; (iii) any content obtained from the Service; and (iv) unauthorized access, use or alteration of your transmissions or content, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence) or any other legal theory, whether or not we have been informed of the possibility of such damage, and even if a remedy set forth herein is found to have failed of its essential purpose.</p>

 <h2>Governing Law</h2>
 <p>These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of California, United States, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.</p>

These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding our Service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might have between us regarding the Service.</p>

 <p>What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.</p>
